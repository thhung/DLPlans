# DLPlans
The project contains the idea (and maybe implementation) of deep learning projects

## Projects ideas

1. Build single/two layers networks from scratch
2. Choose 1 model which is fast to train. Try it with different learning rate. 
3. Use again the models above with different initial weights. 
4. Solve the xor problem with Multi Layer Perceptrons.
5. Implement [this idea](http://crockpotveggies.com/2015/02/09/automating-tinder-with-eigenfaces.html) with deep learning
6. Implement the network for MNIST dataset. 
8. Implement the network for IMGNET dataset.
